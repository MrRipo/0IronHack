    "In this notebook, we will explore the world of interactive data visualization using Plotly, a powerful Python library that allows you to create interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs. Plotly enables you to build interactive dashboards, explore complex datasets, and convey your data-driven insights more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Brief History of Plotly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly was founded in 2012 by Alex Johnson, Chris Parmer, Jack Parmer, and Matthew Sundquist. It emerged as an open-source data visualization library that aimed to provide a simple and elegant solution for creating interactive visualizations. Initially, Plotly started as a JavaScript library for creating web-based charts and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the popularity of Plotly grew, the team expanded its offerings to include Python and R libraries, making it accessible to a broader audience of data scientists, engineers, and analysts. Plotly's Python library, Plotly.py, has become one of the most widely used tools for creating interactive data visualizations in the Python ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Plotly is known for its versatility and ease of use in creating a wide range of interactive visualizations, including scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, 3D plots, and complex dashboards. It has found applications in various industries, from finance and healthcare to education and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll dive into the fundamentals of Plotly, explore its capabilities, and learn how to create stunning interactive visualizations to better understand and present data. Let's embark on this journey of data exploration and storytelling with Plotly!\n",

    "## Comparing Plotly with Seaborn and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to data visualization in Python, there are several libraries to choose from. Among the most popular ones are Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Each of these libraries has its strengths and use cases, making them suitable for different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is one of the oldest and most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. It provides a high degree of customization and fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot or chart. Matplotlib is excellent for creating static visualizations for publications, reports, or basic data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Highly customizable.\n",
    "- Supports a wide range of plot types.\n",
    "- Suitable for creating publication-quality plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Limited support for interactivity.\n",
    "- Steeper learning curve for complex visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and offers a higher-level interface for creating aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations, especially those involving statistical analysis. Seaborn is an excellent choice for quickly exploring and visualizing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Simplified syntax for common plot types.\n",
    "- Built-in support for statistical visualizations.\n",
    "- Works seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Less customizable compared to Matplotlib.\n",
    "- Limited support for highly interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly, on the other hand, specializes in creating interactive and web-based visualizations. It provides an extensive set of tools and features for building dynamic dashboards, interactive charts, and complex data applications. Plotly is ideal for scenarios where you want to engage users with your data interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Interactive and web-friendly.\n",
    "- Supports a wide range of chart types.\n",
    "- Suitable for creating dashboards and web applications.\n",
    "- Easy sharing of interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- May have a steeper learning curve for beginners.\n",
    "- Best suited for web-based applications and online presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib depends on your specific needs and goals. Matplotlib offers fine-grained control and customization, Seaborn simplifies statistical visualizations, while Plotly excels in creating interactive and web-based data experiences. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each library can help you make informed decisions when selecting the right tool for your data visualization tasks."

    "Before diving into interactive visualizations with Plotly, it's essential to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on your dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its characteristics and relationships. This will help you make informed decisions about what and how to visualize. Let's analyse df dataframe together:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Dataset**: Load your dataset using Pandas. You've already done this in your previous code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Summary**: Start by getting an overview of your data. Use functions like `df.head()`, `df.info()`, and `df.describe()` to understand the structure, data types, and summary statistics of your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Missing Data**: Identify and handle missing data if any. You can use functions like `df.isnull()`, `df.dropna()`, or `df.fillna()` to address missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib**: Before diving into interactive visualizations with Plotly, it's a good practice to create static visualizations using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib. Visualize relationships between variables, distributions, and trends. This will give you insights into what aspects of your data you want to explore further.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ask Questions**: Formulate questions about your data. What relationships do you want to investigate? What insights are you looking to gain?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interactive Visualization with Plotly**: Once you have a good grasp of your data, you can proceed to create interactive visualizations with Plotly. Plotly provides powerful tools for creating interactive charts and dashboards, making it easier to explore your data from different angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that EDA is an iterative process. You may need to revisit earlier steps as you discover new patterns or insights. EDA is not just about creating visualizations; it's about understanding your data thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to ask questions and seek guidance as you proceed with your EDA and visualization journey. We can provide assistance and explanations along the way. Happy exploring!"

    "A Scatter Plot is a popular data visualization tool used to display individual data points on a two-dimensional plane. It is particularly useful for visualizing the relationships or correlations between two numerical variables. Each data point on the plot represents a single observation or data record.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Scatter Plot, one variable is plotted on the x-axis (horizontal axis), and another variable is plotted on the y-axis (vertical axis). The position of each data point on the plot is determined by the values of these two variables. Scatter Plots are effective for identifying patterns, trends, clusters, or outliers within a dataset and are commonly used in exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter Plots are versatile and can be customized with various features like colors, markers, and labels to convey additional information. They are especially valuable when examining relationships between continuous data points and can help answer questions about correlation, distribution, and dispersion within the data.\n",
